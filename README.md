# AI-Augmented Path Planning for Underground Miners

This project explores **AI-augmented path planning** in underground mines, combining **reinforcement learning (RL)** and **classical planning (D* Lite)** to guide miners through complex grid environments with **dynamic sensor networks** and **battery constraints**.

It was developed as part of research at **Missouri University of Science & Technology (Missouri S&T)** on energy-aware navigation in underground mining environments.
